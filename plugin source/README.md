[The old way](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/config-management-plugins/#option-1-configure-plugins-via-argo-cd-configmap) to make a CMP in ArgoCD [has been depracated](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/upgrading/2.4-2.5/#argocd-cm-plugins-cmps-are-deprecated) since argocd version 2.4 and will be removed in version 2.6. Instead, [ArgoCD recommends using a sidecar container to the `argocd-repo-server` pod](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/config-management-plugins/#option-2-configure-plugin-via-sidecar).<br>
The `cmp-plugin.yaml` follows the suggested way of making a CMP : it's a configmap containing the definition of a plugin that will be mounted onto the sidecar container.<br>
The `sidecar-only.yaml` file contains only the lines I added to the `argocd-repo-server` deployment of my argocd install.<br>
